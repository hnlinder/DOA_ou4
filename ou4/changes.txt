1. Lowered BUFSIZE to 150.
2. Only allocate BUFSIZE instead of 3*BUFSIZE for node names.
3. Changed all camelCase to snake_case.
4. Added a check for if the entry is empty. Also sets user entries to empty in
        each loop, giving slightly different behaviour in main loop. Now, you
        can't see previous result again by just pressing enter, need valid
        input every time.
5. Moved out the reading of the map file from main to its own function.
6. Renamed str11 and str22 to node1 and node2, respectively.
7. Moved the checks for non-existing nodes from main to a separate function
